# mwwz-shape-match
I've been writing a shape-based template matching algorithm，like find_shape_model、find_scaled_shape_model in halcon.  
It already has some features(Support rotation, scaling, subpixel position), The program can be downloaded and used, and
I hope more people will communicate with me to improve it.
