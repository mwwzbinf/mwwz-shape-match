# the shape-based matching
I've been writing a shape-based template matching algorithm，like find_shape_model、find_scaled_shape_model、find_aniso_shape_model in halcon.  It already has some features(Support rotation, scaling, subpixel position, create model from circle or rectangle), The program can be downloaded and used, I hope more people will disscus with me and improve it. my email is nbamanu@gmail.com, my qq is 66557370, my blog:https://blog.csdn.net/manuoo?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343
